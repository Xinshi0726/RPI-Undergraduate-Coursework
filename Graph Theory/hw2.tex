	Claim: This graph does not have a cut-edge.\\
	We prove this by contradiction.\\
	Proof: Assume $\exists e \in E(G)$ such that $e$ is a cut-edge. Cut edge e will give us 2 separate components, $G_1$ and $G_2$. Since $\forall v \in V(G)$ we have $dv = 2k$(even) where $k \in \mathbb{N}$, $\exists v \in V(G)$ such that $d(v) = 2k+1$(odd) after cutting the edge e. Thus we have a vertex $v \in V(G_1)$ in one component with an odd degree, and the rest of the vertices in $G_1$ has even degrees. Thus the sum of degree in $G_1$ is an odd number. By the hand shaking theorem, $|E(G_1)|$ will not be an integer, which is impossible. Thus we have found a contradiction. Therefore such cut-edge $e$ does not exist.\\

	(a).Let $P(n)$ denote the statment that the number of leaves $l$
	on a tree $T$ with $|V(T)| = n$ is bounded below by the maximum degree of of the tree $k = \triangle(T)$.
	
	Base Case: $n = 1$. We have a graph with 1 vertex. This is trivial. $n=2$, we have a graph with two leaf vertices and an $edge$. $k < l$. $n = 3$. we have a graph with 2 leaf vertices and 2 edges.
	
	Inductive Step: Assume $p(1 \leq k' < n)$ holds, and prove $p(n)$ holds.
	
	Consider the case $k' = n-1$, and we have the tree $T'$. In order to prove $P(n)$ we need to add one vertex $u$ to $T'$. We could only add a leaf since adding a non-leaf edge creats a cycle, which violates the tree's property. Assume the vertex $v \in V(T')$ has the largest degree. We consider two exhaustive cases:
	
	1. $u$ is connected with $v$. In this case, the number of leaf vertices and the maximum degree both increased by one. Thus $k = k+1 \land l = l+1$. Since $l \geq k$ from our inductive hypothesis, $l+1 \geq k+1$. Thus in this case $P(n)$ holds.
	
	2. $u$ is not connected with $v$. In this case, the number of leaf vertices is increased by one and the maximum degree stays the same. Thus $k = k \land l = l+1$. Since $l \geq k$ from our inductive hypothesis, $l+1 \geq k$. Thus in this case $P(n)$ holds.
	
	Therefore P(n) holds in all cases, which means the number of leaves
	on a tree $T$ with $|V(T)| = n$ is bounded below by the maximum degree of of the tree.\\
	
	\newpage
	
	\noindent (b). Let us denote the vertex with the largest degree $v \in V(G)$. Vertex $v$ has $k$ edges, which implies there are $k$ unique paths since trees contains no cycle. The vertex that has the maximal $u-v$ path with vertex $v$ is a leaf node, other wise the path could be extended and the path would not be maximal. Thus the $k$ unique path will reach to at least $k$ leaf nodes, or more if one vertex on the path has degree greater than 2. Therefore $l \geq k$ and the number of leaves 
	on a tree $T$ with $|V(T)| = n$ is bounded below by the maximum degree of of the tree.\\
	
	\noindent (c). From the handshake theorem, we know $\sum_{v \in V(G)} deg(v) = 2|E| $. From the properties of trees, we know $|E| = |V|-1$. For the non-leaf vertices, the degree of each vertex is at least two to stay connected. Let $u$ denote the vertex with maximal degree in $G$, and let l denote the cardinality of the set of leaf vertices. Let leaf be the set of leaf vertices. Then we have the following formula.
	\begin{align*}
		\sum_{v \in V(G)} deg(v) &\geq deg(u) + \sum_{v \in V(G) \setminus L \cup \{u\}} deg(v)+ \sum_{v \in leaf} deg(v) \\
		 2(|E|) &\geq k + 2(|V|-|leaf|-1) + |leaf|\\
		 2(|V|-1) &\geq k + 2|V| - 2l -2 + l\\
		 l &\geq k 
	\end{align*}
	Therefore $l \geq k$ and the number of leaves 
	on a tree $T$ with $|V(T)| = n$ is bounded below by the maximum degree of of the tree.\\
	
	\noindent 4. 
	
	We prove case one by contradiction. Assume $|V(B_1)| \geq |V(B_2)|$ and there does not exist a leaf vertex in $B_1$, which means $\nexists v_1 \in V(B_1)$ such that $deg(v_1) = 1$. Then $\forall v_1 \in V(B_1)$, $deg(v_1) \geq 2$. Therefore $\sum_{v_1 \in V(B_1)} deg(v_1) \geq 2|V(B_1)|$. Since $\forall v_1 \in V(B_1)$, $v_1$ is connected to $v_2 \in B_2 \setminus B_1$, $\sum_{v_2 \in V(B_2)} deg(v_2) = \sum_{v_1 \in V(B_1)} deg(v) \geq 2|V(B_1)|$. Thus we have $\sum_{v \in V(B_1) \cup V(B_2)} deg(v) \geq 4|V(B_1)|$. By the handshake theorem, there are $|E'| = 2|V(B_1)|$ edges. According to the properties of tree, $|E| = |V(B_1)|+|V(B_2)|-1$. $|E'|$ must equal to $|E|$ by the property of tree, which means
	\begin{align*}
		|V(B_1)|+|V(B_2)|-1 &=  2|V(B_1)|\\
		|V(B_1)| &= |V(B_2)|-1
	\end{align*}
	From our assumption, we know $|V(B_1)| \geq |V(B_2)|$. Therefore we have a contradiction. Then there must $\exists v_1 \in V(B_1)$ such that $deg(v_1) = 1$, which means there must exist a leaf vertex in $B_1$. When $|V(B_1)| = |V(B_2)|$, this holds for both components and thus each of them must contain a leaf node.
	
	\newpage
	
	\noindent 5. Since graph $G$ is connected, $|E(G)| \geq |V(G)|-1$. Because $|V(G)| > |E(G)|$, it could only be the case that $|E(G)| = |V(G)|-1$. Therefore $G$ is a tree. Assume the maximal length path $P_1 ,P_2 \subseteq G$ have no intersections and $|P_1| = |P_2| = k$. Let us denote the set $P_1 = \{u_1,...,u_k\}$ and the set $P_2 = \{v_1,...,v_k\}$. For $u_i \in P_1$ and $v_j \in P_2$, there exists a unique path $p_3 = \{q_1,...,q_n\}$ connecting $u_i$ and $v_j$. $\exists a \in p_3$ and $a \notin P_1 \cup P_2$ since by definition $P_1$ and $P_2$ are not connected. Thus we have the non-empty set $Q = \{v:v\in P_3 \setminus (P_1 \cup P_2)\}$. Let us denote the path in $P_1$ starting from the end vertex in $P_1$ and end with vertex $u_i$ with length greater than or equal to $\dfrac{k}{2}$ as $P_1'$. Like wise we have $P_2'$. Since $|P_1'|+|P_2'|+|Q| = \dfrac{k}{2}+\dfrac{k}{2} +|Q| \geq k$, we know $P_1$ and $P_2$ are not the longest path. Thus there's a contradiction and thus $P_1$ and $P_2$ must have common vertices.\\
	
	\noindent 6. 
	Let us draw the following graph
	
	The spanning trees for the first graph on the RHS are $11$ as we discussed in lecture 7. The spanning trees for the second graph on the RHS is the sum of the number of spanning trees for the following graphs.
	\includegraphics[scale = 0.42,angle=90]{"C:/Users/Micha/OneDrive - Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute/Graph Theory/pictures/hw2-6.jpg"}
	
	The number of spanning trees on the first graph on RHS is $2\times 2 = 4$ because there are two edges connecting $d$ and $b$ and two edges connecting $d$ and $e$. The number of spanning trees on the second graph on RHS is $3 \times 2 = 6$ because there are three edges connecting $d$ and $g$ and two edges connecting $g$ and $e$. 
	
	Thus there are in total $11+4+6 = 21$ spanning trees for the graph.

The order of processing order of verticies is $\{a,d,f,g,b,c,e\}$
(b).
We connect the smallest edges.

iteration 1: connect $ad$

iteration 2: connect $df$

iteration 3: connect $fg$

iteration 4: connect $gb$

iteration 5: connect $be$

iteration 6: connect $ec$

Thus we have the spanning tree $T = \{ad,df,fg,gb,be,ec\}$.
